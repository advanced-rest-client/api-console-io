# API Console CLI

API Console version 4 and 5 was using own CLI tool to build a production ready
application. With this release the use of the CLI tool is unnecessary as use of Docker
or simple building configuration should cover your use cases.

Because of that we do not provide a CLI tool for API Console version 6 and up.
If you feel that your use case was not covered here, please, create an issue report
on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mulesoft/api-console/issues).
